#Grid
Really basic css grid, answering only to my immediate needs. Made it to avoid using a whole framework only for its grid system. 

#How to use
In your html code, add this line

```
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/css/grid.css">
```

or, for the minified version

```
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/css/grid.min.css">
```

After that, it basically works like any other grid, with *container*, *row*, *col*,...
